# SubSatellite

A light-weight satellite receiver for Subsonic.  

SubSonic jukebox mode allows you to play music direct on the server hardware.  This is great if your server is hooked up to a sound system, but if it isn't then playing your SubSonic music through your sound system means installing a separate server.

SubSatellite is a lightweight SubSonic client with a cut-down SubSonic Jukebox REST API.  You can install SubSatellite on a node compatible device connected to a sound source and stream music from your existing SubSonic server. 

SubSatellite is controlled using a REST API that is based on the SubSonic Jukebox REST API.  It is recommended that you use an existing SubSonic client to control SubSatellite.

Clients with SubSatellite support are:

* AVSub - http://www.avsubapp.co.uk
